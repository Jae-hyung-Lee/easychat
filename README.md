# Easy Chat

Easychat provides logic as much as possible. This means, the app must provide UI and hook the user event with the easychat logic.

In some case, easychat must provide ui like displaying the list of chat friend list or chat room and message list. But still easychaht provides a way to customise everything.
Easychat also provide sample UI. So, developer can see the code, copy and customise it.

Easychat throws exceptions when there are problems. It is the app's responsibility to catch and handle them.

For sample UI widgets, it provides sucess and error handler.
